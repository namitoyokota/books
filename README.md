## Notes

### Keep Going by Austin Kleon
10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad

#### Naps
> Naps are the secret weapon of many artists. "It's mostly napping." says filmmaker Ethan Coen of his and his brother Joel's creative process. I consider naps to be another form of magical tidying that seems unproductive but often leads to new ideas.
Not all naps are created equal. There are lots of ways to take a nap. Salvador Dali liked to nap while holding a spoon. As he dozed off, he'd drop the spoon and wake up, but still be in the dreamlike state he needed for his surreal paint-ings. Writer Philip Roth said he learned his nap technique from his father: Take your clothes off and pull a blanket over you, and you sleep bet-ter. "The best part of it is that when you wake up, for the first fifteen seconds, you have no idea where you are," Roth said. "You're just alive. That's all you know. And it's bliss, it's absolute bliss."

#### Morning Walks
> Almost every morning, rain or shine, my wife and I load our two sons into a red double stroller and we take a three-mile walk around our neigh-borhood. It's often painful, sometimes sublime, but it's absolutely essential to our day. We talk.
We make plans. We rant about politics. We stop to chat with neighbors or admire the suburban wildlife.
Our morning walk is where ideas are born and books are edited. It's so crucial that we go for our walk that we've adopted the unofficial United States Postal Service motto as our own:
"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom.. stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds." We won't set morning appointments or meetings before we take a walk. Whenever we meet a neighbor, the conversation often starts with, "Are you the couple with the big red stroller?"

### The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield
Winning the Inner Creative Battle

#### Do It
> Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.
Do it or don't do it.
It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children.
You hurt me. You hurt the planet.
You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.
Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being in it.
Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.

### The Pursuit of Holiness

#### Called to be holy
> We are through Christ made holy in our standing before God, and called to be holy in our daily lives.

#### Evidence of holiness
> Is there evidence of practical holiness in my life? pg 25.
